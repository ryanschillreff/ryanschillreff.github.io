                </div>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><b>Evil Lux</b> is a twisted version of Lux that appears as a killer within PARTY CRASHERS. Unlike
                    the original, this version is aggressive, relentless, and seems aware of the dream in a disturbing
                    way.</p>

                <h3>Lore</h3>
                <p>Some players believe Evil Lux is what happens when hope fails after too many resets. The familiar
                    appearance hides something far more dangerous, suggesting the dream can change survivors into
                    hunters.</p>

                <p>Evil Lux moves with purpose rather than fear, hunting players by teleporting directly toward them, as
                    if drawn by their presence. Their ability to regenerate hints that they are deeply connected to the
                    rules of the world itself.</p>

                <p>No one knows if Evil Lux is truly Lux corrupted, a separate entity wearing their shape, or a
                    manifestation of the dream reacting to players who try to escape.</p>

                <h3>Abilities (Lore Explanation)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Teleport:</b> Instantly closes distance, reinforcing the feeling that escape is never
                        guaranteed.</li>
                    <li><b>Regen:</b> Standing still allows Evil Lux to recover, creating tense moments where players
                        must decide whether to interrupt or run.</li>
                    <li><b>Beatdown:</b> A violent forward charge that punishes players caught in its path.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Evil Lux appears cold, intense, and driven, showing none of the hesitation or fear seen in the
                    survivor version.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The HP value of 666 has led many fans to assume Evil Lux represents a corrupted or nightmare
                        version of Lux.</li>
                    <li>Some players claim Evil Lux targets Lux first when both appear in the same match.</li>
                    <li>Fans often debate whether Evil Lux remembers past timelines.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>

                <h3>IMPORTANT NOTE</h3>
                <p><b>This character is NOT a normal playable character.</b> Homer exists only for developers and
                    testing purposes. Players cannot unlock or select this character in normal gameplay.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><b>Homer</b> is a joke survivor inspired by Homer Simpson and designed as an intentionally
                    overpowered testing character. He is used by developers to stress test mechanics, balance changes,
                    and extreme gameplay situations.</p>

                <h3>Lore (Non-Canon)</h3>
                <p>Within the community, Homer is treated as a glitch or anomaly inside PARTY CRASHERS. Some players
                    describe him as a character that “does not follow the rules,” appearing only when developers
                    interfere with the game world.</p>

                <p>Because he is not part of the main story, any appearances are considered non-canon and purely for
                    debugging or humor.</p>

                <h3>Abilities (Developer Use)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Donut Blast:</b> Designed to survive nearly any encounter for testing.</li>
                    <li><b>Self Heal:</b> Allows developers to quickly heal themselves. Heals around 2890 HP.</li>
                    <li><b>Debug Mobility:</b> Often used to move through dangerous areas safely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Presented as humorous and out of place compared to other characters, reinforcing that he is not part
                    of the serious narrative.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Considered a “dev-only” character and should not appear in normal matches.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes referenced in patch notes as an internal testing tool.</li>
                    <li>Community rumors about unlocking Homer are false.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Style Notes</h2>

                <ul>

                    <li><b>Lux & Medic:</b> Players often pair Lux with Medic because Lux’s defensive abilities create
                        safe moments for healing. Many fans see them as representing hope and protection.</li>

                    <li><b>Lux & Toko:</b> Lux avoids direct fights while Toko runs toward danger, making them feel like
                        opposites that balance each other during matches.</li>

                    <li><b>Toko & Medic:</b> Toko’s aggressive playstyle gives Medic opportunities to support from
                        behind, although some players joke that Medic spends most runs chasing Toko around the map.</li>

                    <li><b>Evil Lux & Lux:</b> A major fan theory claims Evil Lux is a corrupted future version of Lux
                        created by too many resets, though others believe it is simply the dream copying survivors.</li>

                    <li><b>Evil Lux Behavior:</b> Players report that Evil Lux feels more aware than other killers,
                        especially due to teleporting directly toward targets.</li>

                    <li><b>Team Symbolism Theory:</b> Many fans interpret the survivors as emotional archetypes: hope
                        (Lux), defiance (Toko), and fear-driven care (Medic).</li>

                    <li><b>Reset Theory:</b> Some players claim subtle animation or behavior changes suggest characters
                        evolve across multiple resets.</li>

                    <li><b>Unknown Connection:</b> A popular speculation suggests Lux, Toko, and Medic may have known
                        each other before entering PARTY CRASHERS, but no confirmed lore exists.</li>

                    <li><b>Homer (Developer Character):</b> Homer is confirmed to be a developer-only joke character and
                        is NOT obtainable in normal gameplay. Any sightings in public matches are assumed to be

                <h2>Community Speculation</h2>

                <ul>

                    <li>Some fans believe Evil Lux exists to punish players who rely too heavily on Lux strategies.</li>

                    <li>There is debate over whether the dream world creates killers from survivors or if killers exist
                        independently.</li>

                    <li>A recurring theory suggests hidden events may occur when Lux, Toko, Medic, and Evil Lux appear
                        within the same match.</li>

                    <li>Developers occasionally referencing Homer in updates has led to jokes that he is "watching from
                        outside the game."</li>
