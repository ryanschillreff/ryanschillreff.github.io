[THREAD] I stumbled upon some old PARTY CRASHERS lore from a guy named Luke and I don't know what to think about it anymore

ok so I don't even know if this is the right place to post this but I figured if anyone cared, it would be people here.

So I was browsing through some old PARTY CRASHERS stuff last night (don't ask why, it's a nostalgia spiral, lol) and I stumbled upon this folder hidden away in an archive labeled something like “partycrashers_notes_real_final_v3” and it was just chock-full of text files written by a guy named Luke. At first, I thought it was just some fan theory nonsense, but the more I read, the more it sounded like he was seriously spooked.

The thing he keeps going on about is that Lux is the only one who feels "real." Not like, main character special, he literally meant REAL. Like, an actual person trapped in the game while everyone else is just going through the motions and not even noticing anything is off. And yeah, I know what you're thinking, "typical ARG brainrot," but the way he writes it, it doesn't sound like he's trying to be all cool and creepy, it sounds like he's actually freaking out.

He goes on about the whole “dream world” theory too and calls it bullshit lol. Like he thinks it was tacked on afterwards as a way to placate people so they wouldn’t investigate further into the lore. He says Lux behaves differently from the other characters because they know something’s off, especially when the matches reset. He just keeps referencing resets like it’s not just in-game but the world itself is resetting. Characters forget things, things go back to normal, and so on. He even says the edits on the wiki page disappear but I don’t know if that’s just normal site business or what.

The Evil Lux part is where things get a little weird. His writing just goes to hell there, lots of typos, sentences just trailing off. He says Evil Lux isn’t just a character but more of a system that just keeps the loop going. Like if Lux gets too aware of something the game just fixes itself. He just keeps saying Evil Lux moves like it already knows what you’re gonna do which is pretty dramatic but again he doesn’t write it like he’s telling a creepypasta, more like he’s confused and a little scared.

And he would NOT stop talking about Blux. I barely even noticed that guy existed before since it was marked as dev-only but Luke thought it was some observer character watching everything. He literally typed the word “observer” 100 times across different notes. Dude was obsessed.

Towards the end, it goes from being theory posts to being more personal, which, honestly, made me feel bad for the guy. He begins to write to Lux as if they could read it. Talking about how every time we reset the game, we’re putting them in the loop again without even realizing it. There’s one line that keeps getting repeated throughout the files that says “we are the loop.” Idk, but that one stuck with me, I guess.

And then the messages just trail off in the middle of a sentence. No goodbye, no conclusion, nothing. Just cuts off.

I tried looking up Luke but came up empty so maybe pseudonym or deleted accounts or whatever. Maybe this is just some dude who takes an ARG a little too seriously but after reading all that I went back to the site and now Lux just... feels... weirdly different? idk how to put that without sounding completely insane.

Anyway yeah. If anyone remembers a user named Luke or has seen anything like this before let me know because this crap has been stuck in my head all day and I kinda hate it lol.

Also before anyone says it yes I know its “just a game,” but thats literally what he kept saying too right before the notes got REALLY weird.

“If Lux is real, someone has to remember them when the reset happens.”

yes. that line is still messing with me.

oRE: I found some old PARTY CRASHERS notes from a guy named Luke and idk what to think anymore

ok first off I wasnt gonna reply because this sounds like classic early ARG bait lol but I actually read your whole post and now I’m kinda uncomfortable too so thanks for that I guess.

I dont remember a <a href="luke.html" style="color: black;">Luke</a> specifically but I DO remember someone back in the day who kept posting about Lux being “aware” and people kinda dogpiled him for taking it too seriously. Could’ve been the same guy or maybe just coincidence because fandoms always have that ONE person who goes full conspiracy mode.

That being said… the reset thing is weirdly accurate. I always thought it was just gameplay flavor but there are moments where Lux’s dialogue feels slightly off compared to everyone else, like they react more like a player than a character. I never thought much of it until you mentioned it but yeah, now that I’m thinking about it, Lux does feel different.

The Evil Lux thing though is where I’m like ehhh idk man. A lot of games have enemies that “predict” movement because of AI patterns, so that alone doesnt mean anything. But I will say there was this one match years ago where Evil Lux just stood there watching me instead of attacking right away and it freaked me out enough that I quit lol. Probably just a bug though.

Also the Blux thing being an observer is peak, this is prolly some shitpost but at the same time dev characters always end up being weird lore holes so who knows.

The part that kinda got me was the notes ending mid sentence. That’s either really good storytelling or genuinely creepy depending on whether this is real or not. Either way now I’m probably gonna replay and see if I notice anything different so congrats you’ve infected another person with this nonsense.

And yeah that line you posted at the end is gonna live in my brain for a while now, thanks for that.

If anyone else remembers this Luke guy, they should speak up because I am curious now too.
